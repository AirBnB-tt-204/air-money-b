Lambda School Build Week webapp API for Optimal Airbnb Pricing, March 2021.

Team members: Temsy Chen, Srini Nariangadu, Paul Teeter and Jose Urena.

This is a webapp named AirMoneyB for users interested in renting a property on AirBnb, who would like to know what the optimal nightly rental price is. A user can keep a record of one or multiple listings. The can input multiple attributes about the listing: city (from a selection of US cities), neighborhood, property type, room type, minimum nights, and number of days available in a year. AirMoneyB determines the price based on historical data comparing similar listings and their prices. This will help property managers make the most of their listings by knowing what the best price, tailored to the specifics of each property.


üí° Features

User can add, edit, and delete listings on their profile, and get an optimal price returned for each listing. Potential future releases may include the ability to add pictures to listings, or have their property price checked weekly and get email or text alerts if there are price changes.
