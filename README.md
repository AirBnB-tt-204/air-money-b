☝️ Proposal

What problem does your app solve? Our app gives an optimal price to users as a reference when pricing their property listings on Airbnb.

Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem? If a user has a property or multiple listings, they will want to know the best price they can get depending on multiple factors: location, number of rooms and bathrooms, etc. This app will determine that price based on historical data comparing similar listings and their prices.

What is the mission statement? Provide Airbnb property managers with the ideal price for their listings and make the most of their business.

💡 Features

What features are required for your minimum viable product? User can add listings and their properties to their profile, and get an optimal price returned for each listing.  

What features may you wish to put in a future release? Users may add pictures to their listings, or have their property price checked weekly and get email or text alerts if there are price changes.
